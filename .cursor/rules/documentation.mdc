## Definition of Done
As per section 11 of `@PROJECT_PLAN.md`, every feature is only "done" when it is documented.

## README
- The main `README.md` should contain a high-level overview, quickstart instructions, and links to more detailed documentation.
- When adding a new feature, update the `README.md` with a small example or mention if it changes the user-facing behavior.

## Configuration
- All new configuration options must be documented in `configs/default.yaml` with comments explaining their purpose and possible values.

## Architecture Decisions
- For significant architectural changes, consider adding a new document to the `docs/adr` (Architectural Decision Record) directory.
